CommandBar for WordPress is the fastest way to control your WordPress site. Boost your productivity with shortcuts and quick actions to navigate WordPress Admin and the Gutenberg editor with ease.

Spotlight-Style Search:
With instant search for anything on your WordPress site, like posts, images, or even products and orders, you can make navigating WordPress Admin blazingly fast.

Pro Shortcuts:
It’s not just content, though. All key actions in WordPress Admin, such as creating posts, are just a couple of clicks away. Or with custom keyboard shortcuts, you can assign a shortcut to any common task, like inserting an image or changing a post’s category.

Contextual Editor Actions:
CommandBar for WordPress works within the Gutenberg editor, too. Switch between recently edited items or launch contextually-relevant actions quickly while editing a page or post.
